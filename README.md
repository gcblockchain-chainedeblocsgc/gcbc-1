So far: BlockSci up and running on AWS, validation against blockchain.info to look at some transactions
Some demo code and output is posted here, but needs the BlockSci AMI running on Amazon AWS (or another install of BlockSci) in order to be run. Please get in touch if you need help setting this up.

Updated to add some examples of feature extraction from the Bitcoin blockchain

ToDo: Building a custom data-science AWS install of BlockSci (almost done)

Additional feature extraction for "data science" (transaction/activity analysis) - more to come, input is welcome
