So far: BlockSci up and running on AWS, validation against blockchain.info to look at some transactions
Some demo code and output is posted here, but needs the BlockSci AMI running on Amazon AWS (or another install of BlockSci) in order to be run. Please get in touch if you need help setting this up.

ToDo: There are a lot of bugs in the version I am running (that appear to have been fixed in subsequent releases), and I need to install it on an image with data science tools on it. Will create a new install on aws.

Feature extraction for "data science" (transaction/activity analysis) - more to come, input is welcome
